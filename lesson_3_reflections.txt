When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  if I want to share my repository contents with others
  to collaborate with public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
	The logic is same as working on 2 different branches. We decide when we want
	to incorporate other developers commits into our own development when we are
	ready.
